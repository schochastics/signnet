# signnet - Methods to Analyse Signed Networks
<!--
General specifications:
- This specification of the Methods Hub friendly README often uses the word 'should' to indicate the usual case. If you feel you need to do it differently, add a comment to argue for your case when you submit your method.
- A Methods Hub friendly README should contain all sections below that are not marked as optional, and can contain more sections.
- A Methods Hub friendly README should contain as few technical terms as possible and explain (or link to an explanation of) all used technical terms.
- A Methods Hub friendly README should link to all code files that it mentions using the [text](URL relative to this file) format. The relative URL (i.e., no "https://github.com") is neccessary for proper versioning in Methods Hub.
- A Methods Hub friendly README should contain an explanation (in the text) and an alternative for each image it contains (e.g., data models, pipeline, schema structure). Format: ![alternative text that describes what is visible in the image](URL relative to this file).
- A Methods Hub friendly README should link to authoritative sources rather than containing a copy of the information (e.g., documentation).
- A Methods Hub friendly README should use a uniform citation style for all references, for example APA7 https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/references/examples

Title:
1. The title must be the README's only first-level heading (line starting with a single '#').
2. The title should make the method's purpose clear.
3. The title (line 1 of this file) must be changed by you, but all other headings should be kept as they are.
4. The title must be appropriate (not harmful, derogatory, etc.).

Section templates:
The README template comes with text templates for each section (after each comment) that can be used, customized or removed as desired.

## Description
<!--
1. Provide a brief and exact description of the method clearly mentioning its purpose i.e., what the method does or aims to achieve in abstract terms (avoiding technical details).
2. The focus should be on explaining the method in a way that helps users with different levels of expertise understand what it does, without going into technical details. It should clearly describe what inputs are needed and what outputs can be expected.
3. Briefly explain the input and output of the method and its note worthy features.
4. Provide link(s) to related papers from the social science domain using the method or similar methods for solving social science research questions. 
5. In a separate paragraph, highlight the reproducibility aspect of the method providing details or references to the resources used by the method, the data used in building the pre-trained modules etc.
6. It should also discuss the decisions and parameters controlling the behavior of the method.

Methods for the analysis of signed networks. This includes
several measures for structural balance as introduced by Cartwright
and Harary (1956) [<doi:10.1037/h0046049>](https://doi.org/10.1037/h0046049), blockmodeling algorithms
from Doreian (2008) [<doi:10.1016/j.socnet.2008.03.005>](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2008.03.005), various
centrality indices, and projections of signed two-mode networks
introduced by Schoch (2020) [<doi:10.1080/0022250X.2019.1711376>](https://doi.org/10.1080/0022250X.2019.1711376).


## Keywords

<!-- EDITME -->

* Network Analysis 
* Signed Networks
* Blockmodelling

## Use Cases
<!--
1. The use cases section should contain a list of use cases relevant to the social sciences.
2. Each use case should start with a description of a task and then detail how one can use the method to assist in the task.
3. Each use case may list publications in which the use case occurs (e.g., in APA7 style, https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/references/examples).
-->

Signet networks offer valuable insights into the dynamics of relationships in social science. By modeling networks with positive and negative ties, such as trust and distrust or alliance and rivalry, researchers can explore the nuanced interplay of influence and group structures within societies. Signed centrality helps identify key actors who exert positive influence or act as polarizing figures, while blockmodeling reveals cohesive subgroups and structural roles, such as brokers or marginalized factions, within the network. These tools are instrumental in studying phenomena like political polarization, social cohesion, and conflict resolution, offering a framework for analyzing both cooperative and antagonistic interactions in complex social systems.

## Input Data
<!--
1. The input data section should illustrate the input data format by showing a (possibly abbreviated) example item and explaining (or linking to an explanation of) the data fields.
2. The input data section should specify which parts of the input data are optional and what effect it has to not provide these.
3. The input data section should link to a small example input file in the same repository that can be used to test the method (this test should be described in the section "How to Use").
-->

`signnet` accepts network data in `igraph` format and includes two example data sets that can be used to test the methods. The sign information is stored in a node attribute `sign`.

<!-- ## Output Data -->
<!--
1. The output data section should illustrate the output data format by showing a (possibly abbreviated) example item and explaining (or linking to an explanation of) the data fields.
2. The output data section should link to a small example output file in the same repository that can be re-created (as far as the method is non-random) from the input data (as described in the section "How to Use").
-->

## Hardware Requirements
<!--
1. The hardware requirements section should list all requirements (storage, memory, compute, GPUs, cluster software, ...) that exceed the capabilities of a cheap virtual machine provided by cloud computing company (2 x86 CPU core, 4 GB RAM, 40GB HDD).
2. If the method requires a GPU, the hardware requirements section must list the minimal GPU requirements (especially VRAM).
-->

Signnet runs on any hardware that can run R.

## Environment Setup
<!--
1. The environment setup section should list all requirements and provide all further steps to prepare an environment for running the method (installing requirements, downloading files, creating directoriees, etc.).
2. The environment setup section should recommend to use a virtual environment or similar if the programming language supports one.
-->

With R installed:

```r
install.packages("signnet")
```

## Repository structure

This repository follows [the standard structure of an R package](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/FAQ/R-exts.html#Package-structure).

## How to Use
<!--
1. The how to use section should provide the list of steps that are necessary to produce the example output file (see section Output Data) after having set up the environment (see section Environment Setup).
2. The how to use section should explain how to customize the steps to one's own needs, usually through configuration files or command line parameters, or refer to the appropriate open documentation.
-->

The package comes with a set of vignettes that can be found [here](https://schochastics.github.io/signnet/).

## Technical Details
<!--
1. The technical details section should proview a process overview, linking to key source code files at every step of the process.
2. In case a publication provides the details mentioned below, the technical details section should link to this publication using a sentence like "See the [publication](url-of-publication-best-using-doi) for ...". In this case, the mentioned technical details can be omitted from the section.
3. The technical details section should list all information needed to reproduce the method, including employed other methods and selected parameters.
4. The input data section should link to external data it uses, preferably using a DOI to a dataset page or to API documentation.
5. The technical details section should mention how other methods and their parameters were selected and which alternatives were tried.
6. The technical details section should for employed machine learning models mention on what kind of data they were trained.
